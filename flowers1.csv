larger and more curved towards the end.  on its thickened base so that
the leaves all lie sideways. In Malaysia this drooping of the leaves is
considered to portend rain and is the explanation of the name Rain Tree,
Hujan-hujan meaning ""rain"", but in India it is believed that the name was
given because of a curious habit possessed by the tree of intermittently
spraying the ground beneath with moisture. Later it was discovered that
this was caused by multitudinous minute insects. The fruit is a fleshy
pod, sweet to the taste and much relished by squirrels, horses and cattle.

Leek is fairly unmistakeable. The heads consist of a ball of bulbils, each 
capable of growing where it falls. Small pink flowers open around these. 
Leaves are just like garlic leaves and also smell like garlic. This form of 
garlic produces very large bulbs that may weigh a pound or more. These huge 
bulbs consist of enlarged cloves, usually six per bulb. The cloves are 
milder than those of regular garlic, so that some people eat them raw. 
Elephant Garlic is native to West Asia, Africa and Europe. "

Onion,Allium cepa,Alliaceae,"
Onions have cylindrical, hollow leaves and an enlarged bulb that
develops at ground level. The roots come off the bottom of the bulb. The
flowers are produced in the second growing season (following a required ""rest""
period) in a rounded umbel (cluster with all flower stems originating from the
same point) on a stalk 2-4 ft tall. The umbels, about 2 in 
in diameter and consisting of many small purplish flowers, are quite showy.
There are hundreds of onion cultivars, differing in day-length requirement,
skin color (white, brown, yellow, red, or purple), size (1-6 in or 2.5-15.2 cm
in diameter), shape (globe-shaped, flattened or spindle-shaped), pungency and
sweetness. Both pungency and sweetness (which are not mutually exclusive) are
determined to a considerable extent by the chemical characteristics of the
soil in which the onion is grown.The onion is known only in cultivation, but
probably was developed from a wild ancestor that grows in western Asia. Onion
seeds have been found in Egyptian tombs dated to 3200 BC, and some authorities
believe the onion may have been one of the first vegetables domesticated by
humans."

Palmyra Palm,Borassus flabellifer,Arecaceae," Palmyra palm is a native of tropical Africa but cultivated and naturalized
throughout India. The palmyra palm is a large tree up to 30m high and the
trunk may have a circumference of 1.7m at the base. There may be 25-40 
fresh leaves. Leaves are leathery, gray green, fan-shaped, 1-3 m wide, 
folded along the midrib; are divided to the center into 60-80 linear- 
lanceolate, 0.6-1.2 m long, marginally spiny segments. Their strong, 
stalks, 1-1.2 m long, are edged with hard spines. In India, it is planted as a windbreak 
on the plains. It is also used as a natural shelter by birds, bats and 
wild animals. The flowers are produced in big clusters of long, white 
string-like inflorences. The coconut-like fruits are three-sided when 
young, becoming rounded or more or less oval, 12-15 cm wide, and capped at 
the base with overlapping sepals. When the fruit is very young, this 
kernel is hollow, soft as jelly, and translucent like ice, and is 
accompanied by a watery liquid, sweetish and potable. The chief product of 
the palmyra is the sweet sap (toddy) obtained by tapping the tip of the 
inflorescence, as is done with the other sugar palms and, to a lesser 
extent, with the coconut. The toddy ferments naturally within a few hours 
after sunrise and is locally popular as a beverage. Rubbing the inside of 
the toddy-collecting receptacle with lime paste prevents fermentation, and 
thereafter the sap is referred to as sweet toddy, which yields 
concentrated or crude sugar (gur in India; jaggery in Ceylon); molasses, 
palm candy, and vinegar. Palmyra palm jaggery (gur) is much more 
nutritious than crude cane sugar. Traditionally, the Indian 'Nadar' 
community are the people who make their living from this tree using its 
wood, fruits, sap, stems, petioles and leaves to process a variety of food 
products, beverages, furniture, building materials, and handicrafts. "

marijuana, and preparations derived from resinous extract, sometimes
called hashish, are usually consumed by inhaling a vapor released by
smoking or heating, or by oral ingestion. Historically, tinctures,
teas, and ointments were also common preparations.  "
Canna, Canna spp.,Cannaceae,"
Canna or Canna lily are extermely common garden plants, that have large,
attractive foliage and horticulturists have
turned them into a large, brash, bright and sometimes gaudy, garden plant. In
addition, it is one of the world's richest starch sources, and is an
agricultural plant. 
Though cannas are among our most common garden plants their flowers are among
the most complex and hard to interpret. In canna flowers the bright ""petals""
are actually stamens modified to look like petals. Such modified stamens are
often called staminodia. Atop the green, roundish ovary arise three small,
usually green sepals, hidden by one of the petals in the image at the left,
but visible in the next picture. There are also three petals, which can be
green or colored.
Although all cannas are native to the South America, they have followed mankind's
journeys of discovery and some species are cultivated and naturalized in most
tropical and sub-tropical regions."

too much heat. Black Hungarian is a vigorous, upright, annual or
short-lived perennial with wide, lance-shaped, often purple-veined,
mid-green leaves. The plant produces beautiful purple flowers and the
chilli pods go from black to dark red over time.  The full ripen pods

"
Capsicum,Capsicum annuum,Solanaceae,"
Capsicum is a popular species cultivated world wide. Despite being a single
species, the capsicum annum has many forms, with a variety of names, even in
the same language. In American English it is commonly known as the chili
pepper, although not all varieties would be recognised by most speakers under
this name. In British English, they are all called peppers, whereas in
Australian and Indian English there is no commonly-used name encompassing all
its forms, the name capsicum being commonly used for bell peppers exclusively.
Its forms are varied, from large to small, sweet to sour, very hot to bland.
The plant is a herbaceous annual, with a densely branched stem. The plant
reaches 0.5–1.5 m (20–60 in). Single white flowers bear the fruit which is
green when unripe, changing principally to red, some varieties may ripen to
brown or purple. While the species can tolerate most climates, they are
especially productive in warm and dry climates. 
Capsicum orginated from Central America where most of the main varieties were
developed by local Indians. Once peppers were discovered by the Spaniards and
Portuguese they were rapidly introduced worldwide and eagerly incorporated
into local cuisines."
Cherry Pepper,Capsicum annuum var. annuum,Solanaceae," Cherry peppers are a very beautiful pod type pepper resembling the shape 
of a round fleshy cherry and measuring about 1 3/4 inch in diameter. The 
hotness ranges from moderately mild to medium hot. One may find the cherry 
pepper labelled as the Hungarian cherry pepper, since they are popular in 
Hungarian dishes. Cherry peppers are an ideal size for pickling or 
brining, and they also make for an excellent garnish on a dish. They 
shouldn’t be thought of as merely good for pickling or for decoration, 
since they are quite tasty. Flowers are quite similar to those of other 
chillies. This chilli is only known in cultivation. "
Chilli, Capsicum frutescens,Solanaceae,"
Cayenne or Capsicum derives its name from the Greek, 'to bite,' in allusion to
the hot pungent properties of the fruits and seeds. Green chilli is 
almost essential to Indian cooking.
Most of the varieties of pepper referred to as chili peppers belong to C.
annuum L. However, some varieties with ""chili"" included in their name are
actually C. frutescens L. Precise categorization of this particular type of
pepper is difficult because of the large number of varieties, and the constant
creation of new ones by hybridization. Forms sold or grown by one name in
certain areas of the country may not be the same elsewhere, even though the
names are the same. "

Griffith's Plum Yew,Cephalotaxus griffithii,Cephalotaxaceae," Griffith's Plum Yew, is a coniferous shub or small tree which is at 
present under threat. It is a gymnosperm - a plant that bears naked seeds 
(i. e., seeds not inclosed in  an ovary), as the common pine and hemlock. 
It is endemic  to northern India, specifically in the Mishmi Hills of 
Assam (at about 2000 m) where it is a small tree 15-30 ft tall. It is also 
found in western Sichuan, China. Needles are 2-3 inches long by 3 mm wide. 
Plum Yews are slow-growing conifers with dark olive to black-green 
foliage. Because their habits range from upright and shrubby to low and 
informally mounding, they can serve as hedges, masses, groundcovers, 
specimens and foundation or container plants. Plum yew's botanical name is 
apt. ""Cephalo-taxus"" means ""head-yew,"" from the Greek ""kephale"" for head 
and the botanical name ""taxus""for the yew genus. ""Head-yew""refers to the 
flowering structures that are borne in tight clusters or ""heads"" and to 
its needles, which resemble those of yew. Another, more appealing common 
name, plum yew, refers to the plum-like shape and color of the ripened 
fleshy ""cone."" "

distinctly powerful at night - this feature has had its influence on
its common name in all languages. The Hindi name translates to queen of
the night, while the Manipuri name means moon flower. No fragrant

Saffron Flower,Crocus sativus,Iridaceae,"
Saffron Flower is a beautiful flower grown mostly in Kashmir in India.
Saffron, which has for decades been the world's most expensive spice by
weight, is native to Southwest Asia. It was first cultivated in
the vicinity of Greece.  After a period of
hibernation in summer, five to eleven narrow and nearly vertical green
leaves, growing up to 40 cm in length, emerge from the ground. In autumn, purple
buds appear. Only in October, after most other flowering plants have released
their seeds, does it develop its brilliantly hued flowers, ranging from a
light pastel shade of lilac to a darker and more striated mauve. Upon
flowering, it averages less than 30 cm in height. Inside each flower is a
three-pronged style; in turn, each prong terminates with a crimson stigma
2.5-3 cm in length. These stigma are hand harvested , dried and used as the
famed saffron. Saffron was traditionally used in coloring the rice in biryani.
Saffron Flower is a fall-flowering perennial plant
unknown in the wild, and is sterile. Being sterile, the Saffron Flower's
purple flowers fail to produce viable seeds—thus, reproduction is dependent on
human assistance: the corms (underground bulb-like starch-storing organs) must
be manually dug up, broken apart, and replanted. A corm survives for only one
season, reproducing via division into up to ten ""cormlets"" that eventually
give rise to new plants. The corms are small brown globules up to 4.5 cm in
diameter and are shrouded in a dense mat of parallel fibers. "

"
Spear Sansevieria, Dracaena angolensis,Asparagaceae,"
Spear Sanseviera, a native of South Tropical Africa and Natal, is one of the
more interesting sansevieras. The cylindrical spearlike, rigid leaves reach
about 5 feet in height and are about 1-¼ inches in diameter. Like all
sansevieras,
they are easy to culture and well suited to the home environment. The
cylindrial nature of the leaf apparently occurs due to a suppression of
dorsi-ventral symmetry, which produces a true top and bottom in most leaves.
Instead, the ""precursor tip"" produced during the earliest stages of leaf
development (usually small in most species) enlarges without breaking radial
symmetry.
In spring it blooms with 1.5 inch flowers which are white tinged with pink.
The flowers open only at night. Spear Sansevieria is a low
maintenance plant. It only needs watering once every three weeks and thrives
at room temperature and doesn’t mind the sun either."

at branch-ends buds appears and the plant starts branching. Each branch
grows for about 10-15 years and re-branches, so a mature plant has an
umbrella-like habit. It grows slowly, requiring about ten years to
reach 4 ft in height but can grow much faster.	Dragon Tree is
cultivated and widely available as an ornamental tree for parks,
gardens. It is	native to the Canary Islands, Cape Verde, Madeira, and
locally in western Morocco.

the base. The upper surface is covered with sticky glands which trap 
insects and digest them. Tiny flowers arise on a leafless scape, 5-20 cm 
long, arising from leaf axils. Burmann's Sundew produces large amounts of

hundreds of tentacles which hold a glad that produces the dew. The dew is very
thick and sticky. When an insect gets stuck to some dew, more tentacles move
to get there dew covered glands against the insect to keep it from escaping.
The glands atop the tentacles then secrete acids and enzymes which dissolve
the insect. The glands then reabsorb the nutrient rich fluid.
The leaf stalk attaches to the center of
the shield. Generally each short stem has one or two leaves and a terminal
single flower, which is flat, with 5 white petals. "

Columbia River Valley in southwestern Washington south into the Baja
peninsula and sporadically on to the Cape Region, west to the
Pacific Ocean, and east to western Texas. This poppy is the state flower of
California. The species is highly variable,

"
Ginkgo,Ginkgo biloba,Ginkgoaceae," The Ginkgo is a unique tree with no close living relatives. It is one of 
the best known examples of a living fossil, because Ginkgoales are not

specimens in China being over 50 m. The tree has an angular crown and long, 
somewhat erratic branches, and is usually deep rooted and resistant to wind 
and snow damage. Young trees are often tall and slender, and sparsely 
branched; the crown becomes broader as the tree ages. During autumn, the 
leaves turn a bright yellow, then fall, sometimes within a short space of 
time (1–15 days). A combination of resistance to disease, insect-resistant 
wood and the ability to form aerial roots and sprouts makes ginkgos very 
long-lived, with some specimens claimed to be more than 2,500 years old: A 
3,000 year-old ginkgo has been reported in Shandong province in China. The 
leaves are unique among seed plants, being fan-shaped with veins radiating 
out into the leaf blade, sometimes splitting. Ginkgos are dioecious, with 
separate sexes, some trees being female and others being male. Male plants 
produce small pollen cones with sporophylls each bearing two microsporangia 
spirally arranged around a central axis. "

"
Balloon Plant,Gomphocarpus physocarpus,Apocynaceae,"
This small tree-like perennial from Jamaica and South America is sure to
invoke curiosity. It's in the Oleander family, and grows 4-6 ft tall.

its other common name.  Like all milkweeds they attract
the lovely wanderer butterfly to the garden. The downside is that the seeds
spread very easily throughout the garden on the breeze, so the plant does have
some weed potential. Another problem is that it exudes a poisonous, milky sap.
However it tastes bad and is not really the sort of thing you'd want to eat."

long), and clusters of long-blooming summer flowers. Both showy sterile
florets and less showy fertile florets appear in each cluster. It flowers
from July to August, with blue or pink lacy flowerheads. The flowers are
perfect, having both male and female parts; they are insect pollinated.
Mountain Hydrangea is made up of a
center of tiny dark blue fertile flowers, surrounded by large sterile petals
of palest bluish-purple. It is bluer in acidic soil than alkaline, but it's
fairly blue in any soil condition. As insects pollinate the fertile flowers of
the center, they turn their petals to reveal pinker reverse side.
Occasionally listed as a vine, it's hard to imagine this compact rounded shrub
as a vine, but the main stems do often bend & twist. If it were trained to an
espalier beginning when still small in size, it could be given to the
appearance of a six foot tall climber. Growth rate is moderate to rapid. "
Hydrangea,Hydrangea macrophylla,Hydrangeaceae,"
Hydrangea is a rounded shrub with huge, deciduous, opposite, serrated, medium
to dark green leaves. It is usually seen at 3-6 ft with an equal
spread, but older specimens can exceed 8 ft. Flowers are arranged in
huge, ball shaped clusters on the most common varieties.
Mophead hydrangeas are the most commonly grown
hydrangeas in the south and other areas of temperate climate.
They are rounded shrubs with oval, mid- to dark-green, deciduous leaves.
Their large, showy flowerheads, commonly
grown today are blue or pink. A few varieties are white. The name probably
comes from the resemblance of the flowerheads to mops.
Hydrangeas are
fascinating in that, unlike most other plants, the color of their flowers can
change dramatically. Changing a hydrangea from pink to blue entails adding
aluminum to the soil. Changing from blue to pink means subtracting aluminum
from the soil or taking it out of reach of the hydrangea.
Though we commonly call it French hydrangea, Hydrangea macrophylla is native
to Japan and Korea. This shrub can naturalize in compatible climates."

Trailing Lobelia,Lobelia erinus ,Campanulaceae,"
Lobelia was introduced more than 200 years ago from the region around the Cape
of Good Hope. The original wild forms of lobelia have been bred to bloom more
profusely. There are both trailing varieties, with billowing masses of
blossoms, and more compact bedding types, seldom exceeding 6 inches in height.
The 1/2- to 3/4-inch-wide flowers, borne along each stem, are blue on the
common varieties, but white and carmine types have also been developed.
The flowers are irregular and bisexual, and are borne singly or in racemes,
umbles or spikes. Petals, sepals and stamens are in fives. The petals are
fused forming a two-lipped corolla, which consists of spreading lobes and a
split tube. The upper lip consists of two often smaller and erect lobes and
the lower lip of three spreading lobes.
Lobelia is prized for window boxes, hanging baskets, planters, and ground
covers. Although the plants do best in full sun and moist, rich soil where
summers are cool, they will grow surprisingly well in hot areas if given
partial shade. Lobelia is not sown directly in the garden because it does not
begin to flower until two months after seed is planted. This plant attracts

Honesty,Lunaria annua,Brassicaceae,"
Common honesty is an old-fashioned, about 1 m tall, hairy-stemmed plant. It 
is a dual-purpose plant, grown partly for its fragrant bright flowers in 
spring and early summer, but also for its unique seed-heads, oval and 
translucent, gleaming with an eerie silver light and coveted by 
dried-flower arrangers. It is properly grown as a biennial, and makes 
large, well-branched plants in its second year, after which it will seed 
itself freely around the garden. However, smaller plants can be grown as 
hardy annuals from an early sowing, with a smaller flower display, but very 
good compact seed-heads. The common name ""Honesty"" arose in the 16th 
century, and it may be due to the translucent seed-pods which are like 
flattened pea-pods and borne on the plant through winter. In South-East 
Asia, it is called the Money Plant, because of its seed pods, that seems 
like silver coins."

Dwarf Magnolia, Magnolia coco,Magnoliaceae,"
Native to China, magnolia coco is a wonderful plant which captures
the beauty of magnolias (normally big trees) in a flower pot. The flowers are
small and very fragrant. They usually last only a day and open in the evening,
the tepals falling by morning. This species is a good houseplant, the most
suitable magnolia for indoors, thanks to its small size and slow growth rate.
Its long flowering period provides indoor fragrance and color about nine
months of a year. Most of magnolias lack nectaries, but the Magnolia coco is a
nice exception. It secrets a nectar-like substance at the base of the tepals
and between the stigmas. Indoors it can be grown as a small house plant in a
pot where it gets only 2-3 ft tall and blooms in young age. Fragrance is
outstanding especially in early morning, and reminds one of champaka.
This probably inspired its other names, Michelia coco and Michelia pumila.

White Mulberry,Morus alba,Moraceae,"
A beatiful, large leaved, naturally well shaped tree that offers dense shade.
Grows at about 1 ft/yr to 30 ft. Berries are mildly sweet, reminiscent of
watermelon.
This is the mulberry used to feed silkworms. Birds love the berries. 
The white mulberry is so-named for the color of its buds, rather than the
color of its fruit. The thin, glossy, light green leaves are variously lobed
even on the same plant. Some are unlobed while others are glove-shaped. Leaves
of the red mulberry are larger and thicker, blunt toothed and often lobed.
Mulberry trees are either dioecious or monoecious, and sometimes will change
from one sex to another. The flowers are held on short, green, pendulous,
nondescript catkins that appear in the axils of the current season's growth
and on spurs on older wood. They are wind pollinated and some cultivars will
set fruit without any pollination. Cross-pollination is not necessary.
Botanically the fruit is not a berry but a collective fruit.  The
color of the fruit does not identify the mulberry species. White mulberries,
for example, can produce white, lavender or black fruit. 
The white mulberry is native to eastern and central China. "

sized plant and is a stunning sight with several 3 ft branched, arching 
spikes in flower, each spike capable of carrying 100 or more 1 inch 
flowers. The flowers are buttercup yellow with a minimum of chestnut 
markings in the centre. The flower shape is reminiscent of a dancing 
doll.  Usually, each bulb produces more than one 
inflorescence at a time. High humidity is essential for this plant as it 
prefers to have it’s roots in the air, only sufficient roots necessary to 
keep it on it’s support come in contact with the mount. Flowering takes 
place around autumn to early winter, having spent most of the summer 
forming its tall and floriferous spikes. The long lasting flowers are 
ideal for cutting. "
Fried Egg Tree, Oncoba spinosa,Salicaceae,"
Fried Egg Tree is a spiny shrub or small tree. It grows up to 5 m, but may
sometimes reach a height of 8 m. The bark of this plant is mottled grey and
rather smooth. The young branches are conspicuously speckled with lenticels (a
slightly raised, lens-shaped area on the surface of the young stems that helps
with the exchange of gasses between the plant and the surrounding air). The
spines are straight and up to 50 mm in length.
The leaves are simple, ovate-elliptic in form with a somewhat pointed tip and
rounded, broad base. The leaves are dark, glossy green in colour and somewhat
leathery and hairless. The margins are coarsely toothed. 
The flowers are 3 inch across, white, honey-fragrant and
solitary. The fruits have a sour, edible pulp. Beautiful white and
yellow flowers look like 'fried eggs' when they drop off and
fall on the ground with their yellow stamens facing upwards. 
Flowers attract butterflies. Blooms late spring to
summer. The hard-shelled fruits are used as snuff boxes. If the fruit are left
to dry with the seeds inside they it make amusing rattles for children and are
also used as anklets and armlets for dancers to add rhythm when performing.
The pulp of the fruit is edible, but is seldom used for that purpose. In
African medicine the roots are used in the treatment of dysentery and bladder
complaints. Fried Egg Tree is native to South Africa."

cities because of its perceived tolerance for urban pollution. It
typically grows as a single-trunk tree to 75-100 ft tall with
horizontal branching and a rounded habit. Trunk diameter typically
ranges from 3-8 ft. The signature ornamental feature of this huge tree
is its brown bark which exfoliates in irregular pieces to reveal creamy
white inner bark. Mature trees typically display mottled white bark
that facilitates identification from great distances. The large 3-5
lobed medium to dark green leaves, 4-9 inches wide, have coarse
marginal teeth. In fall, foliage typically turns an undistinguished
yellow-brown. Small, non-showy, monoecious flowers appear in small
rounded clusters in April. Male flowers are yellowish and female
flowers are reddish. Female flowers give way to fuzzy, long-stalked,
spherical fruiting balls, up to 1 1 cm diameter, that ripen to brown.
Fruiting balls appear in pairs. Each fruiting ball consists of
numerous, densely-packed, tiny seed-like fruits (achenes). Fruiting
balls gradually disintegrate as fall progresses, dispursing their
seeds, often in downy clusters, with the wind.

Common White Frangipani, Plumeria rubra, Apocynaceae,"
There is a lore which says that the name Frangipani derives from a perfume
created by an Italian family of the same name.
Frangipani, also known as the Plumeria, is native to warm tropical
areas of the Pacific Islands, Caribbean, South America and Mexico. They
can grow to be large shrubs or even small trees in mild areas of the
U.S. In tropical regions, Plumeria may reach a height of 30' to 40' and
half as wide. Their widely spaced thick succulent branches are round or
pointed, and have long leather, fleshy leaves in clusters near the branch
tips. Leaves tend to fall in early winter since they are deciduous and
sensitive to cold. Common White Frangipani has very fragrant white
flowers with yellow centers. The petals are small and strongly overlapping,
giving the impression of a flower in the process of unfolding."
Red Frangipani,Plumeria rubra,Apocynaceae," Red Frangipani grows as a spreading shrub or small
tree up to a height of 2-8 m  and similar width. It has a thick fleshy
trunk and sausage-like blunt branches covered with a thin grey bark.
The branches are somewhat brittle and when broken, ooze a white latex
that can be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes. The large
green leaves can reach 30-50 cm long and are arranged alternately and
clustered at the end of the branches. They are deciduous, falling in
the cooler months of the year. The flowers are at branch-ends,
appearing at the ends of branches over the summer. Often profuse and
very prominent, they are strongly fragrant, and have five petals. The
colours range from the common pink to white with shades of yellow in
the centre of the flower. Initially tubular before opening out, the
flowers are 5-7.5 cm in diameter, and only rarely go on to produce seed
- 20-60 winged seeds are contained in a 17.5 cm pod. Red Frangipani is
native to  Mexico, Central America, Colombia and Venezuela. 
"
Frangipani pink, Plumeria rubra , Apocynaceae,"
Frangipani, also known as the Lei flower, is native to warm tropical
areas of the Pacific Islands, Caribbean, South America and Mexico. They

U.S. In tropical regions, Plumeria may reach a height of 30' to 40' and
half as wide. Their widely spaced thick succulent branches are round or
pointed, and have long leather, fleshy leaves in clusters near the branch
tips. Leaves tend to fall in early winter since they are deciduous and
sensitive to cold."
Annual Bluegrass,Poa annua,Poaceae," Annual bluegrass is a widespread low-growing, tufted, annual plant in 
temperate climates. It is one of the sweetest grasses for green fodder,

is open and triangular shaped, 5 to 7.5 cm long. The spikelets are 
stalked, awnless, 1 to 2 cm long when flowering, and loosely arranged on delicate paired or spreading branches. Sometimes they are tinged purple.
The vivid green leaves are short and blunt at the tips, shaped like the 
prow of a small canoe. They are soft and drooping. Long sheaths clasp the 
stem. The leaves are smooth above and below, with finely serrated edges. 
Occasionally the leaves are serrated transversely. It is in flower all 
year around except for severe winters. The seeds ripen and are deposited 8 
months of the year. The plant grows rapidly from seed, flowering within 6 
weeks, seeding and then dying. "
Bulbous Bluegrass,Poa bulbosa,Poaceae," Bulbous Bluegrass is an annual or perennial  grass forming dense 
clumps up to about 2 ft tall. The stems are smooth and hollow and usually 
have bulbous sections at their bases about 1 cm in length. The grass is 
more likely to have bulbous sections if it is growing in a drier area, and 
study has indicated the bulbous sections are mostly water. If the bulbous 
bases are detached and replanted they can give rise to new plants. The 
inflorescence is a wide cluster of branches bearing green leaflike 
spikelets with darker bases that contain bulbils. Viable seed is rarely 
produced, and the plant usually reproduces asexually via its basal bulbous 
sections and via bulbils. "

and cherry, is instead a thick, leathery, grey-green coat, called the
hull. Inside the hull is a netveinedd, hard, woody shell (like the
outside of a peach pit) called the endocarp. Inside the shell is the
edible seed, commonly called a nut. After the fruit matures, the hull
splits and separates from the shell, and an abscission layer forms
between the stem and the fruit so that the fruit can fall from the
tree. Almond tree is native to Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Kazakhstan,
Pakistani Kashmir, Uzbekistan. It is widely cultivated in Kashmir.

called a glasshouse plant because of its outer curtain of translucent
bracts which pass visible light, creating a greenhouse effect, while
blocking ultraviolet radiation. These are important defenses against
the increased UV-B exposure and extreme cold in its high altitude
range. An individual plant is a conical tower of delicate,
straw-coloured, shining, translucent, regularly overlapping bracts. The
higher ones have pink edges. Large, glossy, green radicle leaves, with

call the plant Chuka. The hollow of the stem contains a good deal of
limpid water. After flowering, the stem lengthens and the bracts
separate one from another, turning a coarse red-brown. As the fruit
ripens, the bracts fall away, leaving a ragged-looking stem covered
with panicles of deep brown pendulous fruits. Sikkim Rhubarb is native

parts of India. The thick black skin of the salsify root is usually
considered inedible and can be removed either prior to or after
boiling. If the skin is removed prior to boiling, the peeled root
should be immediately immersed in water mixed with vinegar or lemon
juice, in order to prevent discolouring. Since the root sap is an
extremely sticky latex, it is often more convenient to peel it after
boiling the root for 20 to 25 minutes. Black salsify is often eaten
together with other vegetables, such as peas and carrots. But it is
also popular served like asparagus in a white sauce, such as bechamel
sauce or mustard sauce. Boiled salsify roots may also be coated with
batter and deep fried. "

our Standard Blossom, is this: its anthers are grown together along their
edges, forming a column surrounding the pistil's style. Once the flower is
pollinated, the little ovary will begin growing very fast. The
anther-cylinder around it and the bright petals will dry up, shrivel and fall
away. However the sepals will remain and eventually the ovary will be a
magnificent tomato. "

are sometimes spiny. The flowers are
white to purple, with a five-lobed corolla and yellow stamens. The fruit is a
fleshy berry, 3 cm diameter on wild plants (much larger in cultivated forms),
containing numerous small, soft seeds. Brinjal is an important food crop grown
for its large pendulous purple or white fruit. It has been cultivated in
southern and eastern Asia countries since prehistory, but appears to have
become known to the Western world no more than about 1,500 years ago. 
The raw fruit has a somewhat disagreeable taste, but when cooked, becomes
tender and develops a rich, complex flavour and firm texture. Salting and then
rinsing the sliced eggplant can also remove much of its bitterness. It is
especially useful culinarily owing to its ability to absorb great amounts of
cooking fats, making possible extraordinarily rich dishes. The fruit flesh is
smooth; the numerous seeds are soft and (as in the related Tomato) edible
along with the rest of the fruit."

"
Blue Porterweed, Stachytarpheta jamaicensis,Verbenaceae,"
Blue porterweed is a low, sprawling shrub with a subtle beauty. It is
surprising to some that this native plant of the tropical south east
is being cultivated for the best of gardens. It was considered a weed
for so long.  The leaves are attractive, crinkled and toothed.  It is
a perennial shrub that becomes woody toward the base of the stem as is
grows to about one-year-old.  Plants grow about 4-feet-tall by 6-feet
wide before stems droop and touch the ground. Blue flowers,  about a
quarter-inch in diameter, are borne terminally on long, stringy spikes
at the ends of the stems.  Rich, dark green foliage displayed on square,
green stems makes Porterweed a nice addition to any, sunny landscape.
Porterweed is a prolific bloomer and it attracts a wide variety of
butterfly. They all flock to drink its sweet nectar. More popular garden
varieties are the ones with blue, purple, or coral blooms. Full sun and
drought conditions have little effect on the plant.  Propagation of this
plant is easy, by putting any stem node in water or perlite for two weeks."

Madagascar Jasmine,Stephanotis floribunda,Apocynaceae,"
Madagascar jasmine is an exotic climber suitable for a warm room or a pot
in a sunny window trained round a framework of canes. The
white, waxy blooms give off a rich sent that will spread throughout the house.
Also known as Bridal Wreath, it is the most well known of about 13 species of
the genus Stephanotis. Most representatives originate on Madagascar
but there are also species found in China, Japan the Malabar peninsula and
in Cuba. The Madagascar jasmine is widely cultivated for its lasting waxy
white flowers and intense fragrance. The scent is strongly reminiscent of the
true jasmine, Jasminum officinale, hence the common name. However, these
species are not at all related: The Stephanotis species belongs to the
milkweed family, Apocynaceae, while the Jasmines are members of the olive
family, Oleaceae. Leaves are glossy and dark green, and make a nice contrast
with the snow white flowers."
Java Olive,Sterculia foetida,Sterculiaceae," Java Olive is a tall, straight tree. Originally from East Africa and

faintly ridged.  The branches are whorled and usually horizontal, the 
numerous branchlets gracefully up-curved and crowded at the ends with 
large, palm-like leaves, remind one somewhat of the English Horse-chestnut. 
The flowers, appearing early in February, form at the knotty ends of the 
wrinkled old branchlets immediately beneath the new leaves and spread in 
drooping rays as much as one foot in length. The reddish-green stems bear 
numerous short branched stalks, each terminating in a crimson-brown flower. 
The sepals, which look like petals, (there are no visible real petals), are 
about 1-inch across, back-curling and varying in colour from yellow to pale 
terracotta and to deep crimson and brown. But the main characteristic of 
these flowers is their incredible stench. Coming across a Java Olive 
in bloom ones would think that one was near an open sewer and any part of 
the tree when bruised or cut emits this unpleasant odour. It is unfortunate 
as the tree is extremely handsome; tall and straight, its well shaped crown 
swathed in coral, often without a single touch of green, it stands out 
amongst the surrounding verdure in great beauty and dignity.

center, grow from numerous fairly rigid stems. Plants have blue-green
leaves and grow to 45 to 100 cm in height. The plant is economically
important as a natural source of insecticide. The flowers are
pulverized and the active components, called pyrethrins, contained in
the seed cases, are extracted and sold in the form of an oleoresin.
This is applied as a suspension in water or oil, or as a powder.
Pyrethrins attack the nervous systems of all insects, and inhibit
female mosquitoes from biting. When present in amounts less than those
fatal to insects, they still appear to have an insect repellent effect.
They are harmful to fish, but are far less toxic to mammals and birds
than many synthetic insecticides and are not persistent, being
biodegradable and also decompose easily on exposure to light. They are
considered to be amongst the safest insecticides for use around food.
Dalmatian Chrysanthemum is native to the Balkan region of Europe,
cultivated in India. "

blue/purple, long lived flowers.
Blue orchid is native to NE India where it grows at elevations ranging
from 2500 to 4000 feet in the Himalayan foothills. Botanist William Griffith’s
description of this unusual blue-flowered species in 1847 sparked much
excitement amongst orchid enthusiasts and hybridizers, who were eager to add
this rare plant to their collections. The resulting unsustainable collection
of plants for commercial markets led to rapid decimation of wild populations.
In order to protect remaining wild populations, intact habitat is being
protected and restrictions on international trade of Vanda coerulea have been
enacted. The name ""Vanda"" is derived from the Sanskrit name for the species
Vanda tessellata. Vanda coerulea is one of the few botanical orchids with blue
flowers (actually a very bluish purple; there are no truly blue orchids), a
property much appreciated for producing interspecific and intergeneric
hybrids. Some have flat, typically broad, ovoid leaves (strap-leaves), while

pink or purplish, turning yellow, pea-like, 2.5 cm long.  Because of
its tuberous roots rather than its pods, the wild mung is held in fairly
high esteem in some parts of the world. In Africa, the roots are eaten
in times of severe hunger. It grows wild in the Himalayas and in the
foothills of India. The tubers are soft, easy to peel, and possess a
creamy, white, tasty interior. They are eaten boiled or raw. Protein
content of the tubers is near the 15% level, which is high compared to
the 1-7% for potatoes and yams."

very distinct growth form; the lower leaves being like broad flags, 50–100 
cm long and 5–10 cm wide. The stems are erect, usually 2–3 metres in 
height, with many nodes, casting off flag-leaves at every node. Under these 
leaves and close to the stem grow the ""ears"". They grow about 3 cm a day. 
The ears are female inflorescences, tightly covered over by several layers 
of leaves, and so closed-in by them to the stem that they do not show 
themselves easily until the emergence of the pale yellow silks from the 
leaf whorl at the end of the ear. The silks are elongated stigmas that look 
like tufts of hair, at first green, and later red or yellow. The apex of 
the stem ends in the tassel, an inflorescence of male flowers. Each silk 
may become pollinated to produce one kernel of corn.  "
